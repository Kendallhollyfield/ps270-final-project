## Project thoughts

I am interested in possibly exploring data related to climate change. This is because climate change is very interesting to me, and I feel like is very data based. Since I could study either the changing temperature or the public opinion about climate change policies, there are so many directions I could go with this topic. Climate change has always interested me, and this would be a very cool way to explore it.
